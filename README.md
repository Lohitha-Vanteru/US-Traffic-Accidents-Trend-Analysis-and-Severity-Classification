#  US-Traffic-Accidents-Trend-Analysis-and-Severity-Classification

## Introduction

Roads are shared by various means of transportation such as cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, pedestrians, and animals, and they play a significant role in the economic and social growth of many nations. However, every year, a large number of vehicles are involved in collisions that result in numerous fatalities and injuries. This project aims to address this issue by examining the primary factors that contribute to the increase in the rate of car accidents and developing a predictive model that accurately identifies accident-prone areas to help reduce the frequency and severity of accidents in the USA.

## Dataset Description

In recent decades, accident analysis has been the subject of considerable research due to the prevalence of road accidents. To assist the research community in overcoming limitations in existing datasets, Moosavi et al. (2019) developed a publicly accessible database of accident information called US-Accidents. This large-scale database includes information on 2.8 million traffic accidents that occurred in the contiguous United States between February 2016 and March 2023. The dataset covers various attributes such as location, time, weather, natural language description, points of interest, and more.

## Goals of the Project

- Analyze historical accident data to identify patterns and trends in accident occurrence, contributing factors, and potential solutions.
- Develop a predictive model to accurately identify accident-prone areas and reduce the frequency and severity of accidents in the USA.
- Identify significant predictors of accidents, including road conditions, vehicle types, and weather patterns.
- Explore the use of advanced technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, to improve the accuracy of accident prediction models.
- Develop recommendations for policymakers, transportation agencies, and stakeholders to prevent accidents and reduce their impact on public safety.

## Community Contribution

This project aims to raise awareness and promote data-driven approaches to road safety. By sharing findings with the community, the project contributes to improved road signage, increased law enforcement presence in high-risk areas, public education campaigns, and open-sourcing the developed model for real-time accident alerts and risk assessment.

## Conclusion

The findings from this project can inform the development of strategies and interventions aimed at reducing the frequency and severity of car accidents in urban areas. Potential initiatives include encouraging the adoption of autonomous vehicles, improving public transportation infrastructure, and implementing measures to spread out peak traffic times.
